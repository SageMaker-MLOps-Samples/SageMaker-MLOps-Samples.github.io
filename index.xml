      <description>End-to-End MLOps on AWS: Part1 - Introduction#Authors: Palash Nimodia, Yogendra YatnalkarLast Edited: 01/05/2023 The upcoming series of blogs will try to explain how to build a complete MLOps system on AWS, mainly revolving around the AWS SageMaker ecosystem. The Part-1 of this blog introduces the concept of MLOps, its various constituents and the AWS services that are needed to build them.
Prerequisite: The blog series expects the reader to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:</description>
